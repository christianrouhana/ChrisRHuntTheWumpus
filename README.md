# Welcome to Hunt the Wumpus implemented by Christian Rouhana 2020

This was a personal project to practice my object oriented programming skills in C++. Most 
of my education was in Java, C#, and Python. I had this idea when my brother asked me for help
in his Data Structures project. I liked the prompt, and decided to see if I could implement 
a more  advanced  version using the skills I've learned throughout my degree.

This project was completed using:

	g++ version 9.3.0
	
	Linux Mint 20.04 Ulyana, Kernel 5.4.0-48-generic x86_64
	
	Windows 10 version 2004
	
	Ubuntu Linux 20.04 WSL2
	
	Windows 10 WSL2
	
	Sublime Text
	
	NotePad++
	
	C++ 11

To play this game, navigate to the folder location using a bash terminal tool and run  "./WumpusGame"

#Upcoming features

I plan to add more traditional Wumpus features. I want to add bats and a perception engine that tells the user "they feel a breeze" etc.
